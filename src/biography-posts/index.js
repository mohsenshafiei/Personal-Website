      My name is Mohsen Shafiei Tafreshi and I am Frontend Engineer from Tehran,
      Iran. I was born in Tehran on October 26, 1992, and right now I am 26.
      Currently, I am working as a Frontend Engineer at Snapp.ir. I have started
      programming since I was 18 and I chose that to become a frontend engineer 5 years ago.
      Let me explain it from the begining, it was the summer of 2011 when I
      decided to change my life. Those days I was just a normal printing house worker who had
      finished his school and, he couldn't find any interesting thing in his life. However, I deeply knew
      that I should do something. I really knew that I am deserved to have a better life
      and I need 360 degree full turn in my life. At the first step ّI resigned to continue
      my education but there was something that ّI shoud overcome and that was Iranian National Examination (Konkoor)
      to enter Iranian univerisities. I just started to learn different sciences
      and skills like Math, Physics, English language and etc. I was full of motivation and I really wanted
      to achieve my dreams. After one year of trying and practicing finally, I accepted to continue my education
      in the field of Computer Science. I went to the University of Tehran which is the best university in my country.
      As a computer science student literally I didn't know anything about computers. I was just a normal user of computers
      and in comparison with my classmates at the begining I was zero . I have started to learn the C++ language
      and then Java and etc. I have practiced a lot to learn Algorithms, Data Structures and the most important thing Math.
      It was there that I found that I am good at solving alogrithmic problems.
      Spring of 2013 was a special season for me and I have won the university scholarship award, and, I was the teacher assistant
      for two or more courses at the university and these little things had a big effect in my life. It was there that I found that
      if you want to understand something deeply you should teach it to others and it was there that I learned how can I manage people.
      Believe me handling a class of young eager minds of tomorrow is much much harder than handling teamates and developers.
      One the most important things of my life happened when I was a senior undergraduate student and
      it was finding the angle of life my wife Mandana. After comming of Mandana to my life everything has changed.
      I had to be more powerful, responsible, and etc. After entering the university it was the second big challenge
      of my life because I didn't have money, job and many other things. It was clear to me that if I really want to have
      Mandana in my life I have to conquer another summit. I started to find a good job to earn money to build my life but my skills
      weren't enough. I rejected more than one hundred times bud I didn't give up. I started to learn Web Development skills like Php, JavaScript,
      HTML, CSS and etc. After learning of these skills I was really confident about myself and I was telling myself all the time: If they
      don't give me a job I should create a job for myself and if they don't give me an opportunity I have to create it. I chose that to run my
      startups and at the first try I developed the Desta Application which it was a SMS Spam detector but unfortunately it failed. At the second
      try I developed the Lavilook application which it was a social shopping network and it failed because we couldn't find any investor.
      I have failed and failed again and again but I couldn't earn any money but during this journey I have learned a lot of skills and finally I found
      that I know nothing about being a professinal programming. Once again I have needed a change in my life and I had to chose that my career path.
      During my searchs for finding a job I got a good offer from Varzesh3.ir which it is the most veiwed website in my country. They needed a fulltime
      frontend developer to rewrite one of the product.
