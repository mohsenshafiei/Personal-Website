      `My name is Mohsen Shafiei Tafreshi and I am a Front-End Engineer from Tehran,
      Iran. Right now I am 26 and currently, I am working at Snapp.ir.
      I have started programming since I was 18 and I chose that to become a
      front-end engineer 5 years ago.`,

      `Let me explain it from the beginning, it was
      the summer of 2011 when I decided to change my life. Those days I have been
      just a normal printing house worker who had finished school and, he couldn't find
      any interesting thing in his life. However, I deeply knew that I should do
      something. I really knew that I am deserving to have a better life and I need
      360-degree full turn in my life.`,

      `At the first step, I resigned to continue my
      education, but there was something that I should overcome and that was Iranian
      National Examination (Konkoor) to enter Iranian universities. I just started
      to learn different subjects and skills like Math, Physics, English language
      and etc. I was fully motivated and I really wanted to achieve my dreams.
      After one year of trying and practicing finally, I accepted to continue my
      education in the field of Computer Science. I went to the University of
      Tehran, which is the best university in my country.`,

      `At first as a computer
      science student literally, I didn't know anything about computers. I was just
      a normal user of computers and in comparison with my classmates at the
      beginning, I was zero in programming and computer science. I have started to
      learn a programming language like C++, Java and etc. I have practiced a lot
      to learn Algorithms, Data Structures, and the most important thing Math.
      It was there that I found that I am good at solving algorithmic problems.
      Spring of 2013 was a special season for me and I won the university
      scholarship award, I was the teaching assistant for two or more courses at
      the university and etc.`,

      `These little things had a big effect on my life.
      It was there that I found that if you want to understand something deeply you
      should teach it to others and it was there that I learned how can I manage people.
      Believe me, handling a class of young, eager minds of tomorrow is much, much
      harder than handling teammates and developers. One of the most important
      things of my life happened when I was a senior undergraduate student and it
      was finding the angle of my life my wife Mandana. After coming of Mandana to
      my life everything has changed. I had to be more powerful, responsible, and etc.
      After entering university it was the second big challenge of my life because
      I didn't have money, a job, and many other things. It was clear to me that if
      I really want to have Mandana in my life I have to conquer another summit.`,

      `I started to find a good job to earn money to build my life, but my skills
      weren't enough. I rejected more than one hundred times, but I didn't give up.
      I started to learn Web Development skills like PHP, JavaScript,
      HTML, CSS and etc. After learning of these skills I was really confident
      about myself and I was telling myself all the time: If they don't give me a
      job I should create a job for myself and if they don't give me an opportunity
      I have to create it.`,

      `I chose that to run my startup and at the first try, I
      developed the Desta Application which was an SMS Spam detector but unfortunately,
      it failed. On the second try, I developed the Lavilook application which was
      a social shopping network and it failed because we couldn't find any investor.
      I have failed again and again, but I couldn't earn any money. but during this
      journey, I have learned a lot of skills and finally, I found that I know nothing
      about being a professional programmer. Once again, I have needed a change in
      my life and I had to choose my career path.`,

      `During my search for finding a job, I have got a good offer from Varzesh3.ir
      which is the most viewed website in my country. They needed a full time
      front-end developer to rewrite a product. It was a perfect situation and I
      accepted the offer. At Varzesh3 I have learned how to develop frontend products
      professionally, how to optimize the performance and etc. After four months of
      training and development, I was ready to rewrite the real Anten.ir project.
      I chose that to develop the web application with Vue because they needed
      something fast, easy to learn and most trustable. I have developed the
      Anten.ir in just 23 days and it was a really agile and fantastic experience.
      I have developed other products for the Varzesh3 like HR management panel and
      etc.`,

      `After six months I thought that I need more challenges and issues to
      solve and I want to do something more important. After developing the
      Anten.ir I have got a lot of offers from different companies and I chose that
      to join the Snapp tech team because Snapp was a great, big and international
      company. At Snapp, I had the chance to develop my skill to know JavaScript deeply.`,

      Some of the developers are always coding, and some of them don't even write
      a line in a day. There are developers who want to continue to develop software
      with technologies from 10 years ago and on the opposite side there are
      developers who are always updated and they learn new technologies. Let me
      tell you about a normal day of my life. Usually, I wake up at 6:30 or 7:00
      in the morning and after breakfast I really love to review my codes or surf
      the internet to learn something new. I think that between hours 7 to 8
      the productivity of mine is super high. Always I develop the most important
      parts of the software at the earliest hours of my day.
      `,
      `
      Learning new algorithms, data structures and solving algorithmic problem
      play an important role in my life. I think that it is really fun to solve
      these types of problem and challenge yourself to find the best solutions.
      I am a fan of functional programming and I really love to challenge myself
      to solve problems in a functional way.
      `,
      `
      At 10:00 we have to be present at the office. During my path to the Snapp
      office, I review Medium articles to know what is going on. After a short
      daily meeting, I start my day by reviewing the tasks I must do. I really
      like that to be free when I am coding and I don't really like to someone
      always control me. I am used to planning things based on the severity of
      the problems. Always I resolve hard challenges at first to have time to
      learn new things during the week.
      `,
      `
      From my point of view, one of the best practices that each developer can
      do is to review solutions, code, coding style and etc of other people. I
      really enjoy to do this and discuss with other developers to find new
      solutions for problems. Every day, I devote a small part of my time to do
      this. Believe me it is really fun and actually, you can learn a lot and in
      this way, you can also find a lot of friends.
      `,
      `
      After my work usually walking with my wife is what I do and after coming back
      to our home once again really like to check my works to schedule them and
      also write open source codes.
      `,
      `
      That is it, really simple! :)
