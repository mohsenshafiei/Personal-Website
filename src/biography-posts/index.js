      `My name is Mohsen Shafiei Tafreshi and I am a Front-End Engineer from Tehran,
      Iran. Right now I am 26 and currently, I am working at Snapp.ir.
      I have started programming since I was 18 and I chose that to become a
      front-end engineer 5 years ago.`,

      `Let me explain it from the beginning, it was
      the summer of 2011 when I decided to change my life. Those days I have been
      just a normal printing house worker who had finished school and, he couldn't find
      any interesting thing in his life. However, I deeply knew that I should do
      something. I really knew that I am deserving to have a better life and I need
      360-degree full turn in my life.`,

      `At the first step, I resigned to continue my
      education, but there was something that I should overcome and that was Iranian
      National Examination (Konkoor) to enter Iranian universities. I just started
      to learn different subjects and skills like Math, Physics, English language
      and etc. I was fully motivated and I really wanted to achieve my dreams.
      After one year of trying and practicing finally, I accepted to continue my
      education in the field of Computer Science. I went to the University of
      Tehran, which is the best university in my country.`,

      `At first as a computer
      science student literally, I didn't know anything about computers. I was just
      a normal user of computers and in comparison with my classmates at the
      beginning, I was zero in programming and computer science. I have started to
      learn a programming language like C++, Java and etc. I have practiced a lot
      to learn Algorithms, Data Structures, and the most important thing Math.
      It was there that I found that I am good at solving algorithmic problems.
      Spring of 2013 was a special season for me and I won the university
      scholarship award, I was the teaching assistant for two or more courses at
      the university and etc.`,

      `These little things had a big effect on my life.
      It was there that I found that if you want to understand something deeply you
      should teach it to others and it was there that I learned how can I manage people.
      Believe me, handling a class of young, eager minds of tomorrow is much, much
      harder than handling teammates and developers. One of the most important
      things of my life happened when I was a senior undergraduate student and it
      was finding the angle of my life my wife Mandana. After coming of Mandana to
      my life everything has changed. I had to be more powerful, responsible, and etc.
      After entering university it was the second big challenge of my life because
      I didn't have money, a job, and many other things. It was clear to me that if
      I really want to have Mandana in my life I have to conquer another summit.`,

      `I started to find a good job to earn money to build my life, but my skills
      weren't enough. I rejected more than one hundred times, but I didn't give up.
      I started to learn Web Development skills like PHP, JavaScript,
      HTML, CSS and etc. After learning of these skills I was really confident
      about myself and I was telling myself all the time: If they don't give me a
      job I should create a job for myself and if they don't give me an opportunity
      I have to create it.`,

      `I chose that to run my startup and at the first try, I
      developed the Desta Application which was an SMS Spam detector but unfortunately,
      it failed. On the second try, I developed the Lavilook application which was
      a social shopping network and it failed because we couldn't find any investor.
      I have failed again and again, but I couldn't earn any money. but during this
      journey, I have learned a lot of skills and finally, I found that I know nothing
      about being a professional programmer. Once again, I have needed a change in
      my life and I had to choose my career path.`,

      `During my search for finding a job, I have got a good offer from Varzesh3.ir
      which is the most viewed website in my country. They needed a full time
      front-end developer to rewrite a product. It was a perfect situation and I
      accepted the offer. At Varzesh3 I have learned how to develop frontend products
      professionally, how to optimize the performance and etc. After four months of
      training and development, I was ready to rewrite the real Anten.ir project.
      I chose that to develop the web application with Vue because they needed
      something fast, easy to learn and most trustable. I have developed the
      Anten.ir in just 23 days and it was a really agile and fantastic experience.
      I have developed other products for the Varzesh3 like HR management panel and
      etc.`,

      `After six months I thought that I need more challenges and issues to
      solve and I want to do something more important. After developing the
      Anten.ir I have got a lot of offers from different companies and I chose that
      to join the Snapp tech team because Snapp was a great, big and international
      company. At Snapp, I had the chance to develop my skill to know JavaScript deeply.`,
